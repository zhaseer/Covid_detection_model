# COVID-19 Detection Model

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting COVID-19 using a machine learning / deep learning model based on medical data such as chest X-ray images. The model aims to assist in early detection by providing fast and automated predictions.

## Objectives

* Detect COVID-19 cases from medical images
* Build an accurate and reliable prediction model
* Support healthcare research and learning

## Model Information

* Model Type: Deep Learning / Machine Learning
* Input: Chest X-ray images
* Output: COVID Positive or Negative

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is collected from publicly available sources and includes both COVID-positive and normal cases.
The dataset is used strictly for educational and research purposes.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Flask (if deployed)

## Results

The model was evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Performance may vary depending on dataset size and training configuration.

## Future Enhancements

* Improve accuracy with larger datasets
* Add multi-class classification
* Deploy as a web or mobile application
* Optimize model performance
